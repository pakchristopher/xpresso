Jamaican Blue Mountain
Named after the mist that casts a blue-tinged glow over the Jamaican mountainside, this coffee was grown beneath the peak of the 2,250-meter Blue Ridge. The dew, along with plentiful rainfall and fertile soil, helps create ideal growing conditions. After the harvest, the beans are scrutinized and certified to ensure nothing short of the highest quality. The result: a complex cup with layers of citrus flavor and a hint of cocoa.

Nicaragua La Victoria
High on a mountainside in northern Nicaragua, the La Victoria farm is owned by beloved immigration lawyer Martin Lovo, who named the farm after his wife. Together, they produce a rare, smooth cup from the Maragogype (or the "elephant") bean. Lovo left Nicaragua for Miami after the Civil War in the 1980s and became celebrated for his service to his immigrant community. He later returned and purchased the farm, which provides rich growing conditions with its high altitude and plentiful shade trees. Now Lovo and Victoria work as a dedicated team, advancing the quality of their crop each year. We are proud to offer this earthy, floral coffee— made with extraordinary love and care.

VIETNAM DA LAT
From the cool and mist-shrouded pine forests of Vietnam's Central Highlands comes a rare offering—only our second Starbucks Reserve® coffee from Vietnam. Anchored by the city of Da Lat—nicknamed "The City of Eternal Spring"—the serene environment of the Lam Dong Province offers an escape from the heat—and an ideal environment for the cultivation of high-quality arabica beans. The fertile volcanic soil, constant cool temperatures and seemingly ever-present mist culminate in this—a coffee every bit as distinctive as the land from which it came.
Vibrant acidity highlights notes of kola nuts, toffee and vanilla.

GUATEMALA EL GIGANTE
When a farmer dreams of deepening his connection to nature—and his commitment to carefully managing every step of the coffee cultivation process—the results can be extraordinary. Such is the case with Oswaldo Suchini and his Finca El Gigante, a dream he's been building for 27 years. "The estate has always been my private treasure," he says, reflecting on the history that led to this, his first Starbucks Reserve® selection. His determination is apparent in many ways, from experimentation and tireless process improvements to the fact that his farm is thriving in an area of Guatemala not typically known for coffee. In a country steeped in centuries of coffee tradition, Oswaldo has achieved renown. We're proud to play a role in his story of success.

sun-dried-ethiopia-kayon
Ethiopian coffee from a single farm is a rarity. So it is with particular excitement that we share this, our second offering from Kayon Mountain Farm—and their first sun-dried lot. Kayon translates to "goal," a mantra for these extraordinarily driven farmers who take extra steps in the name of unparalleled coffee. They employ extensive pruning and, remarkably, use half of their land for shade trees. These methods are rarely seen in Ethiopia, where much of the coffee is wild-grown. And Kayon manages each and every step of the coffee's journey: their passion shows throughout the process, all the way to directly exporting, which allows them to ensure that their vision for each cup is realized. With flavors of lavender and lemon, this one is no exception—a true testament to the power of ambition.

el-salvador-san-marcelino-farm
The story of San Marcelino Farm is one of exceptional dedication and survival. In recent years, many Central American coffee growers have lost crops, and even entire farms, to coffee rust and extreme changing weather. Despite this, the co-op at San Marcelino has managed not only to stay afloat but also deliver outstanding coffee by any measure. The meticulous care they devote to each plant is perhaps most evident in this Pacamara coffee—a difficult varietal to grow even in the best of circumstances—that flourishes under their watchful cultivation. Each cup produced is a distinct point of pride for San Marcelino's farmers, with nuanced herbal and citrus notes unfolding in layers of deep complexity.

brazil-california-estate
Nothing thrills us like the opportunity to experience a new flavor in coffee. Thanks to a fermentation method common in wine, beer and cheese, Brazil California Estate delivers a Brazilian coffee unlike any we've tasted. Perfecting the yeast-based process proved elusive; for California Estate owners Luiz and Flávia Saldanha, experimentation was the key: finding the right natural yeast strains was followed closely by diligent work to establish protocols and controlled parameters that would lead to great coffee. Once they refined their approach, they were stunned by the quality in the cup—alluring flavors of caramel and chocolate with an entirely new character and a profile all its own.

kenya-karinga
At the Karinga wet mill in Kenya, coffee beans nourished by rich red volcanic loam are processed using river water—a practice that helps reduce environmental impact. Our first-ever lot from the Gitwe Farmers Cooperative Society, this exquisitely complex coffee stands out even among the many excellent Kenyan coffees. Its vibrant flavor ranges from high acidity to low sweet notes. The cup starts with floral aromas of black tea, gives way to notes of citrus and black currant, and finishes with a long-lingering sweetness reminiscent of brown sugar.
Floral aromas lead to citrus and black currant notes.

colombia-la-casiana
This small lot was grown by a team of women in the Vereda La Casiana district of the renowned Northern Andes coffee region. Since coffee is at the heart of the area's culture and commerce, the women of this co-op are empowered to master more than agriculture; they are entrepreneurs, spreading good environmental, economic, social and business practices. Their inspiring story and relentless drive serve as a fitting backdrop for a coffee that speaks for itself—grown in the high elevation of a storied origin, La Casiana delivers an exceptional cup with pronounced milk chocolate and caramel flavors. This is the first time we're sharing this coffee, and the determination of these extraordinary women points to a promising future.
